# Capstone Project 

Docker is an open-source platform that run applications and makes the process easier to develop, distribute.  The applications that are built in the docker are packaged with all the supporting dependencies into a standard form called a container. These containers keep running in an isolated way on top of the operating systemâ€™s kernel. The extra layer of abstraction might affect in terms of performance. 

Docker provide some facilities, which are useful for developers and administrators. It is an open platform can be used for building, distributing, and running applications in a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, known as Docker Engine. It also provides Docker Hub, which is a cloud service for sharing applications. Costs can be reduced by replacing traditional virtual machine with docker container. It excellently reduces the cost of re-building the cloud development platform. 

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes is compatible with the majority of CI/CD tools which allow developers to run tests, deploy builds in Kubernetes and update applications with no downtime.


## What's the project about?

With this project we used a combination of two names emerge as open-source leaders : Kubernetes and Docker. So, what we have learned from this project is that Kubernetes and Docker are distinct technologies, they are highly complementary and make a powerful combination. 

Docker provides the containerization piece, enabling developers to easily package applications into small, isolated containers via the command line. Developers can then run those applications across their IT environment, without having to worry about compatibility issues. If an application runs on a single node during testing, it will run anywhere.

When demand surges, Kubernetes provides orchestration of Docker containers, scheduling and automatically deploying them across IT environments to ensure high availability. In addition to running containers, Kubernetes provides the benefits of load balancing, self-healing and automated rollouts and rollbacks. Plus, it has a graphical user interface for ease of use.
